This is a copy of my past project which is in a repository with same name in my old github account.

Here i have implemented Angular Client and Three Microservices for a Student Management System.

1.CRUD Service
2.File Uploading Service
3.Notification Service

Here i am using graphql for the microservice internal and external communication except for file uploading service.It is done through a REST API.
I used Bull Queue for the file uploading Service.
